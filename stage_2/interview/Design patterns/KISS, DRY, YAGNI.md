# DRY Principle
### DRY stand for Dont't Repeat Yourself. This means that you should not have duplicated code. It's easier to maintain a code
### that is only in one place, becaause if you need to change something in the code, you just need to change in one place.
### duplicated code make code more complex and unnecessarily larger.

### You also should not write ambigious code. Your classes, your variables, your functions, they should have a specific name
### and their name must match their responsibility. If you have a function, you should know what the function does by just reading
### its name, without being needed to read the code inside of it.

### Dry is about expressing the same thing in two different places. possibly in two different ways.
### It means that It's not only about copy and paste code - yes, this is also included but goes byond that.
### It's also about having different code that does the same thing. Maybe you can have different code in two or more places,
### but they do the same thing in different ways, this is also should be avoided.



# KISS Principle
### KISS is an acronym for Keep It Simple, Stupid. This principle says about to make your code simple. You should avoid
### unnecessary comlexity. A simple code is easier to maintain and easier to understand.

### You can apply this pronciple in the design and in the implementation of the code. You should avoid duplicated code,
### should remove unnecessary features, don't use unnecessary variables and methods, use names for variables and methods that makes
### sense and matches their responsibilities, and always when it's possible, follow know standards of code development.
### You also should separate the responsibilities of your classes and the responsibilities from the layers of the project.

### Sometimes you don't need to implement something new to attend your needs, you can simply make use of features of the
### programming language that you are using. For that, It's good that you know the features of the programming language that you are
### working with

### If you are working in a code that it's already implemented, and you see something it's not necessary or could be simpler, 
### you should consider refactoring it.



# YAGNI Principle 
### YAGNI stands for You Aint't Gonna need It. It's a principle from software development methodology of Extreme Programming(XP).
### This principle says that you should not create featurures that is nore really necessary.
### This principle is similar to KISS principle , once that both of them aim for a simpler solution. 
### The difference between them is that YAGNI focus on removing unnecessary functionality and logix, and KISS focus on the complexity.

### Ron Jeffries, one of the co-founders of the XP, once said:
### Always implements things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.

### It means that you shoul not implement functionality just because you think that you may need it someday, but implement it just when you 
### really need it. Doing that you will avoid spending time with implementations that were not even necessary, and maybe will never be used.


# Conclusion
### Follow these principles, will allow you to write better code. Remember that a clean code it’s easier to main, easier to understand and for sure 
### it will save your time when you need to change or implement something. Avoid use duplicated code, try to keep your code as simple as possible, 
### and just implement features when it’s really necessary.
