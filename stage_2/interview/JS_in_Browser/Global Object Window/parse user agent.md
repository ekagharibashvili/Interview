### Every time your web browser makes a request to a website, it sends a HTTP Header called "User agent".
### The user agent string contains information about your web browser name, operating system, device type and lots of other useful bits of information.
### But every browser sends its user agent in a different format, so decoding them can be very tricky.
### Use this tool to parse any user agent string you want to understand.
