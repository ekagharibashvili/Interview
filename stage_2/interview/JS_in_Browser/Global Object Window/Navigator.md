# Navigator
### The navigator interface represents the state and the indentify of the user agent. It allows scripts to query it and to register themselves to carry on some activities.
### A Navigator object can be retrieved using read-only window.navigator property.

#### It has so many methods and properties and other stuff. I think it shouldn't required knowing them by heart.

#### You can see it here [navigator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator)
