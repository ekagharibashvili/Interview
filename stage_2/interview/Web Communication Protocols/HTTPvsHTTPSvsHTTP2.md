## HTTP
### HyperText Transfer Protocol(HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermdeia documents such as Html
### It wad designed for communication between web browser and web serve, but it can also be used for another purposes.
### HTTP follows a classical client-server-model, with a clinet opening a connection to make a request, then waiting 
### until it receives a response. HTTP is a statless protocol, meaning that the server doesnt keep any data(state) between two
### requests.

## HTTPS 
### HypetText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an encrypted version of HTTP protocol. This secure connection allows clinet to safely
### exhange sensitive data with a server, such as when performing banking activities ar online shopping.

## HTTP/2
### It is a major revision of HTTP.
### Thi primary goals of HTTP/2 are to reduce latency, minimize protocol overhead via efficient compression of HTTP header fileds,
### and add support for request prioritization and server push. 
### HTTP/2 does not modify the application semantics of HTTP in any way.
