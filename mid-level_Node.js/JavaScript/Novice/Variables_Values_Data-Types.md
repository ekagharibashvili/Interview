<h3>Variables - Know how to declare variables</h3>
<p>We have 4 ways to declare javascript variables: using var, using let, using const and using nothing, the names of the variables is called identifieres. JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.</p>

```js
var a = 5; // with var
let b = 3; // with let
const c = 2; // with const
d = 1; //with nothing
```

<h3>Values - Know how to assign values to variables</h3>
<p>In javascript, the equal sign(=) is an assignment operator, not an "equal to". The "equal to" operator is written like "==" </p>

<h3>Literals - Know basic String, Number, Object, Array literals</h3>
<p><b>String literal</b> is zero or more characters enclosed in double(") or single(') quotes. 
<b>Numeric literals</b> include integer literals in different bases as well as floating-point literals in base-10. <b>Object literal</b> is comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces({}). <b>Array literals</b> are list of the expressions, which creates the array, enclosed in a pair of square brackets. It's length depends on the numbers in this list.</p>

<h3>Primitive Data Types</h3>
<p>In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null.
Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.
All primitives are immutable, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may be reassigned a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.</p>
